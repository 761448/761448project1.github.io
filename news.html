             Explains how Video-Powered Solutions are Recreating Claims Management for Insurers

            “Video technology is proving to be a game changer for the insurance industry, dramatically transforming the way claims are reported, received and handled,” says Stefan Metzger. “Manually handed, heavy management processes are prime targets to changes.”
            
            Excerpts from L'Agefi's article:
            
            "Video technology is proving to be a game changer for the insurance industry, dramatically transforming the way claims are reported, received and handled.
            
            As a result, some insurers have started adopting new video solutions to reduce the time taken to process a claim and improve customer satisfaction. With the potential to capture and transmit claims evidence in real time via smartphones, while meeting stringent standards of data integrity, the use of video is moving into the mainstream and achieving adoption at scale.
            
            By using secure visual confirmation video technology for insurance claims, assessment for claims can be undertaken more rapidly based on the captured photos and videos."

            Discusses Job Trends for the Digital Age
           “The vision behind our newest report is to profile futuristic jobs which leverage the power of artificial intelligence to blend technology with the ‘human touch’ for jobs in the future workplace," says Rob Brown.

            Excerpts from Forbes’ article:

           “As we enter 2019, its' the combination of AI and human intelligence that will transform work and workers as we know it.

           Creating new jobs as artificial intelligence becomes more widespread inside companies will be a huge priority for C-suite leaders in 2019.

           The Center for the Future of Work at Cognizant Technology Solutions tackled this issue with  two reports, 21 Jobs for the Future and 21 More Jobs For the Future of Work. These jobs have been organized from low tech to high tech over the 10-year horizon from 2019 to 2029.

           Since the first report was released, many of the anticipated new jobs have come to life, such as Financial Wellness Managers, to Memory Curator and Augmented Reality Journey Builder jobs currently at Facebook.”
